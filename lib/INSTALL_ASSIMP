Open Asset Import Library (assimp) INSTALL

Getting the documentation
------------------------------

A regularly-updated copy is available at 
http://assimp.sourceforge.net/lib_html/index.html

A CHM file is included in the SVN repos: ./doc/AssimpDoc_Html/AssimpDoc.chm.
To build the doxygen documentation on your own, follow these steps:

a) download & install latest doxygen 
b) make sure doxygen is in the executable search path
c) navigate to ./doc
d) and run 'doxygen'

Open the generated HTML (AssimpDoc_Html/index.html) in the browser of your choice.
Windows only: To generate the CHM doc, install 'Microsoft HTML Workshop'
and configure the path to it in the DOXYFILE first.

Building Assimp 
------------------------------

More detailed build instructions can be found in the documentation,
this section is just for the inpatient among you.

CMake is the preferred build system for Assimp. The minimum required version 
is 2.6. If you don't have it yet, downloads for CMake can be found on
http://www.cmake.org/. 

For Unix:

1. cmake CMakeLists.txt -G 'Unix Makefiles' -DASSIMP_BUILD_TESTS=OFF
2. make

lib->contains .dylib file

Building Assimp - Comprehensive
--------------------------------

A few things before starting: make sure you have installed XCode Command Line Tools (that installs the GNU compiler). These are the steps I followed:

1. Download the latest release of Assimp and extract it (I got the file from here, the one with source only: http://sourceforge.net/projects/assimp/files/assimp-3.0/)
2. If you don't have it, install CMake (http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html; I'm currently using an older version, but the latest one should work fine as well)
3. Create a build directory (should be outside the source directory)
4. Open CMake and point it to the folder you created at step 1 (where it says "Where is the source code"); the other folder ("Where to build the binaries") should point to the folder created at step 3
5. Click "Configure" on the bottom; it will ask you which environment you'd like to use. I picked "Eclipse CDT 4 - Unix Makefiles"
6. You should get a list of options; the two I selected were "BUILD_STATIC_LIB" and "ENABLE_BOOST_WORKAROUND"
7. Click "Generate"
8. Now you should move to the terminal and go to the folder created at step 3
9. Type "make" and launch it; you should see the build progressing without issues
10. When the build is finished, type "sudo make install"; it will ask for your password and install the library
11. After the last step you should be able to include the library in your code:

#include <assimp/cimport.h>
#include <assimp/scene.h>
#include <assimp/postprocess.h>
